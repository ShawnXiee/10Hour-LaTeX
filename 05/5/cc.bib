 abstract={We have proposed a micromachined system with the aim of controlling injection of DNA into cells. The injection system is composed of two components: hollow microcapillaries for injection and microchambers for trapping cells. The hollow microcapillary array, the most important part of the system has been fabricated. In this paper, we present a micromachined DNA injection system and the fabrication of hollow microcapillary array. Bosch deep reactive ion etching (RIE) etching was used to etch small, deep holes, approximately 5 µm in diameter and 100 µm in depth, on a silicon substrate, and enabled the fabrication of microcapillaries with microchannels inside. The fabricated hollow microcapillaries are 1 µm in thickness, 30 µm in length and 5 µm in diameter, and are made of SiO2. The height of the microcapillaries can be easily controlled. Silicon substrate with microcapillaries is bonded anodically with a processed glass substrate, and enables the silicon membrane to endure pressure from outside during DNA injection. By back-side silicon etching in TMAH solution and making holes on tips of microcapillaries, the fabrication of hollow microcapillaries is completed. Hollow microcapillary arrays can also be used in some applications other than DNA injection, such as microchannels in fluid delivery systems.},

 abstract={In the delivery of DNA molecules by microfluidic devices, the channel width is very often in the same order as the size of the DNA molecules and the applicability of continuum mechanics at this level may be questioned. In this paper we use finitely extendable nonlinear elastic (FENE) chains to model the DNA molecules and employ the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method to simulate their behavior in the flow. Simple DPD fluids are found to behave just like a Newtonian fluid in Poiseuille flow. However, the velocity profiles of FENE chain suspensions can be fitted with power-law curves, especially for dilute suspensions. Some results on the conformation and migration of FENE chains are also reported.},
