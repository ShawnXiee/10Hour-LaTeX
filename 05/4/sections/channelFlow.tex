\section{Channel flow of FENE chain suspension}\label{channel flow}
We use DPD particles and FENE chains to model the suspension of macromolecules in three kind of micro-channels. We use DPD particles and FENE chains to model the suspension of macromolecules in three kind of micro-channels, which are shown in figure \ref{fig:quad} and figure \ref{fig:slop} respectively.
