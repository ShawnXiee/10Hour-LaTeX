\section{Introduction}

Section \ref{sec:history} presents a short overview of the philosophy and history of LaTeX. Section \ref{sec:basic} focuses on the basic structures of a LaTeX document.

\subsection{History}\label{sec:history}
TeX is a computer program created by Donald E. Knuth. It is aimed
at typesetting text and mathematical formulae. LaTeX was originally written by Leslie Lamport.

\subsection{Basic structures}\label{sec:basic}
To help the reader find his or her way through your work, you should divide
it into sections, subsections and subsubsections. LaTeX supports this with special commands that take the section title as their argument. It is up to you to use them in the correct order.
\subsubsection{Title}\label{sec:title}
To publish something, authors give their typed manuscript to a publishing
company.
