 abstract={A small (50-kg, 2-m long) underwater vehicle with operating speeds of 20-30 cm/s and ranges up to 6000 kin has been developed and field tested. The vehicle is essentially an autonomous profiling float that uses a buoyancy engine to cycle vertically and wings to glide horizontally while moving up and down. Operational control and data relay is provided by GPS navigation and two-way communication through ORBCOMM low-earth-orbit satellites. Missions are envisioned with profile measurements repeated at a station or spaced along a transect. The initial instrument complement of temperature, conductivity, and pressure sensors was used to observe internal waves and tides in the Monterey underwater canyon.},

 abstract={SLOCUM is a small gliding AUV of 40 000-km operational range which harvests its propulsive energy from the heat flow between the vehicle engine and the thermal gradient of the temperate and tropical ocean. The design of both the glider and the thermal engine are discussed including the design genesis and approach, field trial results, concept strength, and limitations and potential use.},

 abstract={ABSTRACT  Underwater gliders are autonomous vehicles that profile vertically by controlling buoyancy and move horizontally on wings. Gliders are reviewed, from their conception by Henry Stommel as an extension of autonomous profilling floats, through their development in three models, and including their first deployments singly and in numbers. The basics of gliders function are discussed as implemented by University of Washington in Seaglider, Scripps Institution of Oceanography in Spray, and Webb Research Slucom. Gliders sample in the archetypical modes of sections and "virtual mooring." Preliminary results off Monterey. A wide range of sensors has already been deployed gliders, with many under current development, and an even wider range of future possibilities. Glider networks appear to be one of the best approaches to achieving subsurface spatial resolutions necessary for ocean research.},
